    <p>Maybe, it's the way you say my name</p>
    <p>Maybe, it's the way you play your game</p>
    <p>But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you</p>
    <p>But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you</p>
    <p>And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime</p>
    <p>And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine</p>
    <p>'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions</p>
    <p>Wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine</p>
    <p>And I see forever in your eyes</p>
    <p>I feel okay when I see you smile, smile</p> 
    <p>Wishing on dandelions all of the time</p>
    <p>Praying to God that one day you'll be mine</p>
    <p>Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time</p>
    <p>I think that you are the one for me</p>
    <p>'Cause it gets so hard to breathe</p>
    <p>When you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free</p>
    <p>When you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy</p>
